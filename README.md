## Feature
Use greedy algorithm, so that you can battle with computer which almost take the best step everytime.

## Notice
It should be noticed that, this game can only be played on windows plateform, since I include `windows.h` in view.
I'm archiving this repository for I'm not going to update it any longer, but the algorithm is interesting, so maybe it's still worth a see.
